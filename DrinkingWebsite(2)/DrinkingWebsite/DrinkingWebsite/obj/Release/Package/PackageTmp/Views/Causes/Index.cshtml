                Causes and Risk Factors
            </h2>

            <div class="blog-post" style="word-wrap: break-word; word-break: normal;">
                <p class="lead">Alcohol use disorder (AUD) can be caused by a number of factors. During prolonged consumption of alcohol, your brain begins to depend on its own chemicals to function. The withdrawal symptoms caused by heavy drinking can be uncomfortable for heavy drinkers who wish to quit. </p>
            </div>

                <h3>Biological Factors</h3>
                <hr><p class="lead">Biological factors, such as genetics and physiology, have been shown to have a strong correlation with alcoholism. Individuals with strong urges to continue drinking alcohol may be able to limit their consumption, whereas others are unable to do so. The brain becomes accustomed to repeating this behaviour after consuming alcohol. You are more likely to develop alcoholism if you repeat such behaviours often.</p>
                <p class="lead">Additionally, certain chemicals in the brain can make you more vulnerable to alcohol abuse. Scientists, for example, believe up to 51 genes may be associated with alcohol dependence. The likelihood of family members developing drinking problems is much higher if these genes are passed down through generations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="blog-post" style="word-wrap: break-word; word-break: normal;">
                <h3>Environmental Factors</h3>
                <hr><p class="lead">The proximity of alcohol retailers and bars to people and their chances of becoming alcoholic has been studied by many researchers. It is said that the more near a bar or a bar, the more likely one is to drink. </p>
                <p class="lead">The alcohol industry also bombards the public with advertisements. There are many advertisements presenting drinking as an enjoyable, fun and relaxing activity. </p>
                <p class="lead">The amount of alcohol a person consumes can also be affected by income. It's generally assumed that wealthy individuals don't drink as much as those living below poverty, but that's far from true. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="blog-post" style="word-wrap: break-word; word-break: normal;">
                <h3>Social Factors</h3>
                <hr><p class="lead">A person's views on drinking may be influenced by social factors. Many of your behaviours, including drinking, are influenced by culture, religion, family, and work. The most important factor that affects a person's likelihood of becoming addicted to alcohol is their family. The risk of children falling into a dangerous drinking pattern increases when they are exposed to alcohol abuse at an early age. </p>
                <p class="lead">It is also possible to become more susceptible to alcoholism after you start college or seek a new job. As these times pass, you begin building relationships with your peers by making new friends. As part of your desire to fit in and be liked, you might engage in activities you usually wouldn't. AUD is a condition where you don't know when to stop drinking and go to every office happy hour. You also drink more frequently and crave alcohol after a long workday.</p>

            <div class="blog-post" style="word-wrap: break-word; word-break: normal;">
                <h3>Physiological Factors</h3>
                <hr><p class="lead">
                    Alcoholism may be caused by different psychological factors. Situations are handled differently by every individual. You can, however, determine certain behavioural traits depending on how you handle these feelings. Mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression and stress can increase the risk of alcohol addiction. Alcohol is often used by individuals with psychological disorders to suppress their feelings and relieve their symptoms.
                    It is possible to develop an AUD over time when drinking becomes habitual. Alcohol makes your body tolerant to its effects as more and more people turn to it to ease pain and hardship. There is a serious side effect associated with co-occurring alcohol abuse and mental illness such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The issue should be addressed by a medical specialist separately in order to resolve each one.

                <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
                <hr><p class="lead">Alcoholism can be caused by a number of risk factors. It is important to note that a drinking problem is not inevitable if you have a drinking risk factor; however, it is worthwhile to consider those factors to prevent drinking. Ask a medical professional for warning signs and prevention resources if you have one or more risk factors. </p>
                <p class="lead">There are several risk factors associated with alcohol abuse:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-post" style="word-wrap: break-word; word-break: normal;">
                <h3>Drinking at an Early Age</h3>
                <hr><p class="lead">Young people who experiment with alcohol may face problems in their 20s and 30s. Adolescents who binge drink frequently are at risk. It is possible for someone at any age to become affected by alcohol abuse, regardless of how they began drinking. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="blog-post" style="word-wrap: break-word; word-break: normal;">
                <h3>Family History with Alcohol Addiction</h3>
                <hr><p class="lead">Alcohol abuse is more likely to occur for generations to come when family members and close relatives who are alcoholics are around. Alcohol use can vary drastically depending on your environment, meaning you might be influenced by bad habits if you're around people who drink excessively. </p>
            </div>


            <div class="blog-post" style="word-wrap: break-word; word-break: normal;">
                <h3>High Levels of Stress</h3>
                <hr><p class="lead">The use of alcohol as a stress reliever can quickly become problematic. Stress-prone careers such as doctor, nurse, emergency rescue worker, construction worker and military personnel are associated with long hours and strenuous tasks. A natural de-stressing method must also be incorporated into the schedule of professionals of any industry in order to prevent alcohol abuse. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-post" style="word-wrap: break-word; word-break: normal;">
                <h3>Peer Pressure</h3>
                <hr><p class="lead">Drinking with a partner or close friend may increase your likelihood of joining them. Excessive alcohol consumption can cause a range of health problems, and therefore are not recommended. Make yourself the designated driver rather than feeling the need to drink. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-post" style="word-wrap: break-word; word-break: normal;">
                <h3>Frequent Alcohol Consumption Over a Long Period</h3>
                <hr><p class="lead">The likelihood of developing a drinking problem increases greatly when excessive drinking becomes a habit. Your body becomes more tolerant to alcohol as you drink more. As you get used to drinking more alcohol, you will need more alcohol to experience the same effects. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-post" style="word-wrap: break-word; word-break: normal;">
                <h3>Short-term and long-term risks</h3>

                <h3>Short term risks</h3>
                <hr><p class="lead">Short-term binge drinking results in more immediate and temporary symptoms, but can still have an adverse impact on your health and happiness on a daily basis. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="lead">Memory loss</li>

            <div class="blog-post" style="word-wrap: break-word; word-break: normal;">
                <h3>Long term risks</h3>
                <hr><p class="lead">When alcohol abuse affects the organs, permanent damage and even death are possible through binge drinking's long-term effects. An excessive amount of alcohol can also exacerbate mental illnesses.</p>
