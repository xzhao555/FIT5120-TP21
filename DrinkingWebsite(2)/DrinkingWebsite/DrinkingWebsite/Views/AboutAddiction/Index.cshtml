            <p class="lead" style="">
                Alcoholism commonly known as alcohol use disorder is the most severe form of alcohol abuse and involves the inability to manage and control drinking habits due to physical and emotional substance. Those with alcoholism have a daily urge to drink despite related legal and health issues. When a person is dependent on alcohol, changes are observed in the brain which includes physical withdrawals like insomnia, nausea, sweating, anxiety, and physical discomfort if a person doesn’t drink. Alcohol use disorder is further classified into three categories: mild, moderate, and severe and each of it has various symptoms and can cause harmful side effects.

                    <h3 class="h3">Early Alcohol Abuse</h3>
                    <span style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; display: block; width: 15%; height: 5px; background-color: #edab00;"></span>
                    <p class="lead">Alcohol abuse starts in the early phases of exposure to different types of alcohol and experimentation with alcohol in various forms. In the early phases of alcohol abuse, a person will begin to recognize alcohol's effects and might even develop an addiction. Drinking is usually a social event among young people, so they binge drink as a way of partying. Students usually experiment with alcohol in high school or as young adults in college. The risk of developing alcohol use disorder still exists for them even if they are not regular drinkers. When a person attains a blood alcohol content of 0.08 or higher in two hours, it is called binge drinking. For women, depending on body weight, this usually takes four drinks; for men, it requires five drinks within two hours. </p>                    <p class="lead">A person's consumption of alcohol during a given period is not only influenced by environmental and genetic factors, but also by the number of drinks they consume. Physiologically, men are at less risk than women whose intake exceeds fours drinks per day or 14 per week. Women whose intake exceeds 3 drinks per day or 7 per week are considered at risk.</p>

                    <span style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; display: block; width: 15%; height: 5px; background-color: #edab00;"></span>
                    <p class="lead">There is a strong correlation between consumption frequency and intention to consume alcohol in moderate quantities. Drinking regularly may increase the risk of developing an alcohol use disorder in an individual who has a strong emotional connection to drinking compared to someone who just drinks with a meal. An individual who is experiencing problems drinking is often out of control with alcohol consumption, or exhibiting signs that drinking is interfering with daily life activities. In such cases, the person would begin to show  3 to 5 symptoms and may or may not be physically dependent on alcohol. In other words, the end of drinking will lead to withdrawal symptoms. An individual who is experiencing problems drinking is often out of control with alcohol consumption, or exhibiting signs that drinking is interfering with daily life activities. A mental health or addiction counsellor would be the best person to talk with about safe options for alcohol detox and anyone seeking to detox from alcohol should consult a medical professional first. </p>

                    <h3 class="h3">Severe Alcohol Abuse</h3>
                    <span style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; display: block; width: 15%; height: 5px; background-color: #edab00;"></span>
                    <p class="lead">Alcohol abuse symptoms of six or more suggest a need for treatment intervention. As we explore the potential consequences of excessive alcohol consumption (such as poor health, relationship conflict, financial troubles, and precarious employment status), it is important to consider the category of heavy drinkers referred to as ‘highly functioning’." It is estimated that 20 percent of individuals who abuse alcohol are highly functioning but not immune. Health problems and diseases associated with alcohol abuse are a major concern. Symptoms of chronic heavy alcohol abuse range from mild to severe, but include the following: Cardiovascular disease, Anaemia, Cirrhosis, Cancer, Seizures, Depression, High blood pressure, Nerve damage, Pancreatitis, and Infectious diseases. </p>

                    <h3 class="h3">End-Stage Alcohol Abuse</h3>
                    <span style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; display: block; width: 15%; height: 5px; background-color: #edab00;"></span>
                    <p class="lead">When someone no longer controls his or her alcohol consumption, it becomes a control over them. Those who suffer from alcohol use disorder can think of the end stage of the problem as the worst possible manifestation. There is a reversal in this situation, and most likely a person in the end stage drinks to survive, rather than allowing his drinking to control him. An individual's ability to control drinking has been lost at this point. Withdrawal symptoms may be so painful if a person has habitually abused alcohol over a long enough period that they are motivated to continue to drink to prevent them. Alcohol causes the liver to produce scar tissue instead of new health tissue as long as it consumes alcohol continuously. With time, scar tissue develops in the liver, preventing adequate blood flow. In addition to chronic illnesses and conditions, these scars also impair the body's ability to clean toxins, control infections, process nutrients, and absorb certain vitamins. People suffering from alcohol addiction may also be at risk of falls and other accidents because of balance and coordination disorders. </p>
                    <p class="lead">Self-harm may also be committed by an alcoholic in the advanced stages of alcohol abuse. Alcoholism can leave a person feeling powerless because it is out of their control. As stated, withdrawal can be painful. Alcohol abuse is in its final stages, and it is always possible to get help, as depression associated with alcohol abuse can lead to the termination of a life.</p>
